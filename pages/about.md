# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I’m an aspiring Data Scientist with a academic background in
Computer Science eager to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world
problems. Proficient in Python, R, and SQL, with hands-on experience in
data analysis, machine learning, deep learning and data visualization through self-made projects. I leverage tools like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and PowerBi and Tabula to extract insights and build predictive models.

A quick learner with a passion for continuous improvement, I am committed to
developing innovative solutions to complex challenges. I’m seeking an
opportunity to contribute to data-driven decision-making and grow
within a dynamic team.
